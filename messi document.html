<h1 style="color:aqua">How messi insipired me</h1>
<ul type="square">
  <li>messi crossed oceans and came to a different country at a younge age just to follow his dream of becoming a footballer which inspires me to push for my dreams </li>
  <li>though messi mostly plays the most important part in winning the honours for his team,he always makes sure to give due credits to his teammates and serves as an inspiration for great leader cultivating good team culture</li>
  <li>messi despite being the best footballer of all time & one of the most influential men always stays humble and i admire his humility </li>
  <li>messi has always strived to do his best for his national team but to his misfortune he always lost the finals & come short of the ultimate glory till 2021 in between which he also retired once from international football but then cameback again and now he has won everything for his national team argentina as well and this is the biggest lesson i've learnt following messi that sometime we might be pushed to the edge & hit rock bottom but what's important is to get up & keep trying and we will eventually win</li>
